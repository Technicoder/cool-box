Goal: The user should be able to type into the input and click a button to change the greeting.

We nee to see / manipulate on the screen:
(this will be a list of everything that needs an id in JS)
1) text input
2) button
3) greeting

Grab everything we need: 
1) greeting
validate by logging out
2) input
validate by logging out
3) button
validate by logging out

OnClick: (when the user clicks the button)
validate that the button is listening
Get user input from the text input element
console log the user input
Change the textContent property of the greeting element with user input
 change to user input
We want this to happen when the button is clicked.

The Process
1) grab some DOM elements
2) add event listeners to some of those elements
3) in response to user actions, we _do things_ to those elements
